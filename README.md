# Incident-Response-Flow



## Overview
This project outlines a structured Incident Response (IR) flow that can be applied in real-world security operations. The flow is designed to guide organizations through identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents while maintaining compliance and ensuring minimal business disruption.

## Objectives
- Standardize the incident handling process
- Improve detection and response time
- Ensure lessons learned are documented for future resilience
- Align with industry frameworks (NIST, ISO 27035, CIS)

## Key Steps in the Flow
1. **Preparation** – Define policies, train staff, establish monitoring tools
2. **Identification** – Detect and verify potential security incidents
3. **Containment** – Short-term and long-term containment strategies
4. **Eradication** – Remove root causes, patch vulnerabilities, strengthen defenses
5. **Recovery** – Restore systems to normal operations securely
6. **Lessons Learned** – Conduct post-incident review, update documentation, refine response plans

## Tools & Technologies
- SIEM platforms (Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel)
- Threat detection tools (IDS/IPS, EDR solutions)
- Incident ticketing/tracking systems
- Documentation templates for IR reports

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cybersecurity operations
- Threat detection and analysis
- Playbook creation and process design
- Compliance alignment with security frameworks
